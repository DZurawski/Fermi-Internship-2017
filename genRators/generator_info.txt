Here are R files that either generate completely new data or modify existing data.

"add_z_to_file.R"
	Given the public_train_100MeV.csv data set found in the datasets folder,
	save a new data set with linear sloping z values.

"create_linear_data.R"
	Create a large number of events containing linear tracks (tracks that do not
	curve).

"standardize_100MeV.R"
	Create a new data set from public_train_100MeV.csv with the exact same data,
	but in a standardized format: 5 columns, (event_id, column_id, phi, r, z).

"uniform_data_generator.py"
	A python script that generates uniform track/event data.
	Events generated have a uniform distribution of track sizes.
    	So, for example, if you wanted 300 events with a max track size of 10,
    	then there would be 30 events with just one track, 30 events with two
    	tracks, ..., and 30 events with 10 tracks.
