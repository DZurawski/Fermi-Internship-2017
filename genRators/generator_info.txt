Here are R files that either generate completely new data or modify existing data.

"add_z_to_100MeV.R"
	Given the public_train_100MeV.csv data set found in the datasets folder,
	save a new data set with linear sloping z values.
"create_linear_data.R"
	Create a large number of events containing linear tracks (tracks that do not
	curve).
"standardize_100MeV.R"
	Create a new data set from public_train_100MeV.csv with the exact same data,
	but in a standardized format: 5 columns, (event_id, column_id, phi, r, z).
