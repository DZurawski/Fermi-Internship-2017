Tracker/datasets

Contains two folders: "npz" and "raw".

"npz" contains .npz files that contain train and target information. They can be extracted using the "load_file" function from the Tracker/tracker3d/loader module.


"raw" contains .csv files. These files are raw files that have not yet been processed by the "load_frame" function from the Tracker/tracker3d/loader module.
