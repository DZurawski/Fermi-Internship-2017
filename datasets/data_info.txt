This is the datasets folder.
Here, small testing data sets are stored.
If you would like to see how the data sets were generated, the R code can be found
in the genRator folder.

"public_train_100MeV.csv"
	The RAMP data set. Note that this data set was generated and not actually
	data from real physics collisions.

"standard_100MeV.csv"
	A standardized version of the RAMP data set. Originally, the RAMP data set
	consisted of many columns and redundant information. The standardized version,
	"standard_100MeV.csv", consists of just 5 rows:
	(event_id, cluster_id, phi, r, z)
	Note that the z value is always 0, so that the 2D characteristic of the original
	data set is maintained.

"standard_curves100MeV.csv"
	This is the standardized version of the Ramp data set, but for each track, the
	z value slopes up or down linearly.

"uniform_train_without_z.csv"
	This data set consists of generated data in the form of the RAMP data set.
	It is NOT the RAMP data set, but its columns and organization are similar.
	It consists of (25 * 160 = 4000) events.
	For each number n from 1 to 25, there are 160 events with n tracks.
	Each track consists of up to 9 hits. Not all tracks are the same length.

"uniform_train_with_z.csv"
	This is the standardized "uniform_train.csv" data set, but for each track,
	the z value slopes up or down linearly. The slope was determined by uniform
	randomly selecting a slope for each track.

"ramp_zpr_n10.npz"
	A file containing two numpy arrays.
	The first numpy array consists of training events from the
	"standard_curves100MeV.csv" data set. Data is organized according to
	z, phi, r. Hence, the *zpr* tag within the file name.
	The second numpy array consists of target probability matrices from the
	"standard_curves100MeV.csv" data set.
	For each event, there are 10 noisy hits (hits that belong to no track).
	Hence, the tag *n10* within the file name.

"unif_zpr_n10.npz"
	A file containing two numpy arrays.
	The first numpy array consists of training events from the
	"uniform_train_with_z.csv" data set. Data is organized according to
	z, phi, r. Hence, the *zpr* tag within the file name.
	The second numpy array consists of target probability matrices from the
	"uniform_train_with_z.csv" data set.
	For each event, there are 10 noisy hits (hits that belong to no track).
	Hence, the tag *n10* within the file name.
